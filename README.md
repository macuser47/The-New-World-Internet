# The New World Internet
Internet over SMS. Imagine it.

The New World Internet project will use send webpages over sms.
 Many smartphones have unlimited texting but lack unlimited data.
 To help people have constant internet access for free, we are 
 making a server that can send websites through text to your 
 phone from our server. The is a phone number, which will be
 released when the server is fully up and running.

This is the server code only-- the client is coming soon!
